# Interview_Assignment_NMAMIT_Y_Nidhi_Shenoy

This repository contains the following:
1. Solution file for problem 1 (problem1.py)
2. Test cases for problem 1 (problem1_test.py)
3. Solution file for problem 2 (problem2.py)
4. Test cases for problem 2 (problem2_test.py)

This is in accordance with the format requested in the instructions given for the technical assessment.

The solutions have been coded using Python.

A solution walkthrough is present in each of the solution files (problem1.py, problem2.py) in the form of multiline comments after the code. The comments are my attempt to explain my thought process about the approach taken.

Note:
I have actually solved these problems on LeetCode before. So for these files, first I made sure to code the absolute first approach that came to mind honestly. Then, due to my previous exposure to the same, I meditated some more on the problem in the hope of coming up with a concept that can optimize the existing solution. I have taken the liberty of including both of these efforts here.
